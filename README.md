## ⚡ Core Features  
- **Farm Dashboard** → Weekly prioritized insights on weather, market, and crop health.  
- **Crop Disease Diagnosis (CNN-based)** → Farmers upload a photo; AI identifies crop/disease, severity, and remedies.  
- **Market Intelligence** → Real-time mandi prices, 7-day trend forecasts, and sell/hold recommendations.  
- **Government Scheme Finder** → Simplified, localized explanation of subsidies and eligibility.  
- **Yield Prediction** → Combines soil, rainfall, and NDVI to estimate crop yield.  
- **Weather Forecasting** → 5-day farmer-focused weather insights (rain, heat, risk).  
- **Disease Outbreak Forecasting** → Predicts regional outbreaks based on weather & image data.  
- **Carbon Credit Estimation** → Advises farmers on agroforestry practices for income diversification.  
- **AI Assistant (Voice/Text)** → Conversational interface in local languages (e.g., Malayalam, Kannada).

## 🛠️ Technical Methodology  

### 1. Input Layer  
- Multimodal: Voice, text, and images.  
- Metadata: GPS, crop type, season, history.  

### 2. Preprocessing  
- **Voice → Text**: Transformer-based ASR tuned for local dialects.  
- **Image → CNN**: EfficientNet/ResNet/MobileNet (disease classification + severity).  
- **Text → NLU**: Transformer-based intent recognition.  

### 3. AI Modules  
- **Disease Detection** → CNN + metadata fusion.  
- **Market Forecasting** → Prophet, ARIMA/LSTM, mandi API integration.  
- **Yield Prediction** → Random Forest + NDVI satellite data.  
- **Scheme Navigation** → Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on government docs.  
- **Weather & Outbreak Risk** → Spatio-temporal + weather API fusion.  

### 4. Knowledge & Memory  
- **Firestore** for farmer history and personalization.  
- **Continuous Learning Loop** → Improves accuracy with real queries + feedback.  

### 5. Output Layer  
- **Voice**: Text-to-Speech with natural prosody.  
- **Text/Charts/Maps**: Price trends, geo-maps, and yield reports.  
- **Escalation**: Low-confidence queries routed to human agri experts.
